# Tracking Our Universe
![](solarsystem.jpeg)
## Introduction
The project will display the scaled down version of the solar system. The planets will be to scaled to each other and the sun. The motion of the planets will also be scaled to the actual orbital speed. I have an interest in astronomy and physics and therefore wanted to begin project that will eventually add a simulation of asteroids and their projected paths near Earth. 

### Relative size comparison, setting Mercury to a diameter of 2px

## Getting Started
The page will load and display the solar system. The user can click on any of the objects on the window. A side display will appear with facts from the object that was selected. The second page will have a scroll bar that the user can use to move the planes in accordance to their orbital speed. 
## API's Used
[Solar System OpenData](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies/) - The API will provide the information relating to every object in the solar system.
